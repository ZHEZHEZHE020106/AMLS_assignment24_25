This project is designed to classify medical images using various machine learning and deep learning models on the BreastMNIST and BloodMNIST datasets. The key tasks include binary classification for BreastMNIST (Task A) and multi-class classification for BloodMNIST (Task B). 

The role of each file:
A.py : The code for task A which is binary classification task on the BreastMNIST
B.py : The code for task B which is multi-classes classification task on the BloodMNIST
Datasets: Should contains the datasets used in task A and B
main.py : The main file to run, it will run A.py and B.py files.

The packages required to run:
numpy
scikit-learn
torch
torchvision
matplotlib
medmnist
PIL
